This project shows the predicted results for the US Primaries in each county in the US. 

*I collected data of the demograhpics of each county in the US, along with the 2016 US Primary results for the Democratic and Republican Party






# Results
After applying our model to each county in 2032, our results showed that Donald Trump won even more counties than 2016. Counties where Ted Cruz won in 2016 flipped to Donald Trump. Interestingly, John Kasich lost all counties he won in 2016. Marco Rubio also lost a few counties and only has won 2 counties in 2032.
